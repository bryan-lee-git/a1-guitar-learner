Intro & Description:
The A-1 Guitar Learner App provides anyone learning the guitar one place to go to in order to find everything that they need to begin playing the guitar! It offer tuning assistance, a metronome, access to tabs and chords to their favorites songs, and training videos for songs they want to play.

Motivation:
With the A-1 Guitar Learner App, guitar students need not be restricted in their training source material or tied down to special equipment. The App is mobile responsive, so goes wherever the Learner goes, and provides access to millions of songs to learn, far beyond what any “beginner guitar” training manual would provide.

Results:
The A-1 Guitar Learner App provides access to the Songsterr database of guitar tabs and chords, including for bass guitar. If it’s on Songsterr, the A-1 App can bring it to you. If you need more support, you can search for your song via YouTube and get back only training videos that will guide you step by step through the song. Meanwhile, the tuner will keep you on key and the metronome on time. Anywhere you go. Anytime you want.

Upcoming Improvements:

    •	Integrate music player so you can play the song you’re working on - options for Spotify, Google Play, Amazon Music, Apple Music, etc.
    •	Use the app to help find local instructors - Google Maps/Places API
    •   Log-in with Facebook, Twitter, other thrid-parties	

This web application was created as a group project for the University of Utah / Trilogy Education Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp in September 2018.
